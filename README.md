# hello-world
This is my first repository

Hi, my name is John. I am learning to program, and I'm starting with Python. I already completed 95% of Zed A. Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way," which definitely started to annoy me as I started to really get through it. Anyway, this is my first venture into GitHub; I'm excited to learn about how to use it and how it will help me (and let me help others, I hope!) as I continue to learn. :)
